>Without utilizing any high-level prior information about expected objects, purely low-level information such as intensity, color and texture does not provide the desired segmentations.

>  However, given a training set of arbitrary prior shapes, there remains an open problem of how to define an appropriate prior shape model to guide object segmentation

>  we focus on image segmentation, and propose a shape prior constraint term by deep learning to guide variational segmentation.
