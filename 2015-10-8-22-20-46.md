transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level.

 * The first layer of representation typically represent the presence or absence of edges at particular orientations and locations in the image.
 * The second layer typically detects motifs by spotting particular arrangements of edges, regardless of small variations in the edge positions.
 * The third layer may assemble motifs into larger combinations that correspond to parts of familiar objects, and subsequent layers would detect objects as combinations of these parts.

**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** 

 * A few examples (small sets)
 * computing the outputs and the errors
 * computing the average gradient for the examples
 * adjusting the weights accordingly

***It is called stochastic because each small set of examples 
gives a noisy estimate of the average gradient over all examples.***


good features can be learned automatically using a general-purpose learning procedure is the key advantage of deep learning.
