transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level.

 * The first layer of representation typically represent the presence or absence of edges at particular orientations and locations in the image.
 * The second layer typically detects motifs by spotting particular arrangements of edges, regardless of small variations in the edge positions.
 * The third layer may assemble motifs into larger combinations that correspond to parts of familiar objects, and subsequent layers would detect objects as combinations of these parts.
