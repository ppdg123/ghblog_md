Methods for pose-normalized representations have been proposed, but generally presume bounding box annotations at test time due to the difficulty of object detection.

The recent success of convolutional networks, like [27], on the ImageNet Challenge[23] has inspired further work on applying deep convolutional features to related image classification [14] and detection tasks [21].

A limitation of these methods is their use of weak features (usually HOG [12]).
